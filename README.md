# File-Encryption-Tool

A simple and secure file encryption tool built with Python and Tkinter. This tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using AES-based encryption provided by the cryptography library.

File Encryption & Decryption: Encrypt any file and create a .enc encrypted version, then decrypt it when needed. Dynamic Encryption Key Generation: Each session generates a unique encryption key for added security. Simple and Clean GUI: Easy-to-use interface with color-coded buttons for intuitive navigation. Display Encryption Key: View the encryption key required for decryption.

Future Improvements: Add password-based encryption for user-defined keys. Implement batch encryption for multiple files at once. Enable cloud storage integration for encrypted files.
